# Currency Convert REST API

Description

## How it works:
### **1. Docker. First, you need to install docker**
* Download Docker [Here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/). Hint: Enable Hyper-V feature on windows and restart;
* Then open powershell and check:
```bash
docker info
```
or check docker version
```bash
docker -v
```
or docker compose version
```bash
docker-compose -v
```
### **2. Spring boot app**
* Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adrianobaz/rest-currency-convert.git
```
* Build the maven project:
```bash
mvn clean install
```
* Running the containers:

This command will build the docker containers and start them.
```bash
docker-compose up
```
or

This is a similar command as above, except it will run all the processes in the background.
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

Appendix A.

All commands should be run from project root (where docker-compose.yml locates)

* If you have to want to see running containers. Checklist docker containers
```bash
docker container list -a
```
or
```bash
docker-compose ps
```
